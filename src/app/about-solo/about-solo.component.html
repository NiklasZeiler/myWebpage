            <h3>Why did I become a software developer?</h3>
            <span>The first time I developed something was at school when I created our graduation CD with
                PowerPoint.For me, becoming a software developer was the next logical step. After working in the car
                industry for seven years and becoming more and more interested in programming, I decided to turn my
                passion into a profession. Some time ago I started to read up on programming with the help of the
                literature and wrote my first small projects. I soon realized that I could do this with the help of
                professional support. When I became aware of the Developer Academy in 2021, I decided to start training
                there to become a software developer. During this training, I learned to write many projects alone or in
                teamwork. With the help of experienced software developers, I was able to reach a higher level.

            <h3>What are my strengths?</h3>
            <span>My way of working is characterized by a lot of reliability, commitment, and independent work. Due to
                my previous work in a large car dealership, I can handle stress well and always find a solution. As a
                result, I also have a very high degree of initiative, which was additionally promoted by creating my
                projects. When working with several people, my ability to work in a team came in handy. My willingness
                to learn and my interest in solving new tasks are also among my strengths.

            <h3>What are my skills?</h3>
            <span>During my further education, I learned various front-end technologies such as HTML5, CSS3 and
                JavaScript. The framework Angular and the associated TypeScript are other technologies that I can use. I
                can also handle techniques such as Responsive Web Design. With object orientation, I have programmed a
                small game. Thanks to experienced software developers, I was able to constantly improve my skills and
                find and fix errors in code.
